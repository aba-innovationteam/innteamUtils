# This is part 1: Showing level A {-}

Automatic theming within `Rstudio`. It inteds to be fast rendering and the output is ready-to-read (format) in both **PDF** and **HTML**. 

## Level B {-}

This file is what a user will see when they select your template. Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. In particular you will want to update the `output` field to whatever format your template requires.

This is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides. Ideally it should knit out-of-the-box, or at least contain clear instructions as to what needs changing.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`. Remember that fotenotes are not end-of-page but end-of-document.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- seq(1:5)
x
```

#### Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}

dt <- as.data.table(mtcars)

dt[, cyl := as.factor(cyl)] %>% 
    ggplot(
        aes(
           x = hp,
           y = mpg,
           color = cyl)) + 
    geom_point() +
        theme_innteam() + 
            scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual', palette = 6) +
                 labs(title = 'Another mtcars Plot',
                      subtitle = 'But this time it is a data.table',
                      caption = 'The theme is coherent with the overall theme in the package')

# R Markdown {-}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots {-}

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
